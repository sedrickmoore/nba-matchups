# Welcome to NBA Matchup!

## The Game

Each round, you must guess which of two players have the higher stat in the chosen category.


You have one minute to make as many correct guesses as you can.


A correct guess is 10 points, but guess wrong, and you lose 10.


Guess correct twice in a row, and points double.


Guess correct 5 times in a row, and points triple.


You may skip if you are not sure and want to preserve your points.


## Keep In Mind

This is for the '23 -'24 season!


As a curveball, rookies are included, but do not have stats.


You can change your favorite team in the top right corner.


You can toggle light/dark backgrounds in the top left corner.
